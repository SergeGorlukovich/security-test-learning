Models Can Fail. Tips for anticipating the unexpected:
Expand your awareness - use empirical evidence
Don’t rely on averages to mitigate risks. Normal distributions don’t fit all situations
Focus on risks that are extremely impactful or extremely common
Defend against outcomes, not specific events
Take a few small risks, as these may present little downsides, with unlimited upsides
